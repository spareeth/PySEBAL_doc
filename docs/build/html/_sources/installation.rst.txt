To test whether the PySEBAL will run, open OSGeo4W Shell, and type following commands.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   # After each command click enter
   # Any line starting with '#' is comment line
   # First enable python 3 by typing the following command and 'enter'
   py3_env 
   # Change drive
   D:
   cd PySEBAL_dev\SEBAL
   # open python
   python
   # import one of the PySEBAL Script
   import pysebal_py3
   # If there are no errors, the installation is successful
   # To exit from python
   exit()

Installation in Linux
=====================

The below steps are tested in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, it should also work in other Linux distibutions, you may have to adapt some of the installation steps accordingly. This is also valid for installation in **Bash for Windows** app with Ubuntu inside windows 10.

.. note::

   You can check the python version using the command ``python --version`` in a terminal

Installing dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++++++
The dependencies packages are same as those in windows except for msys. We also install git to download and clone the PySEBAL_dev repository.

Open a Terminal and type in following commands to install required packages. You should have admin rights to install packages.

.. warning::

   Please remove all the QGIS and GRASS packages you may have installed from other repositories before doing the update.

.. code-block:: Shell
   :linenos:

   # After each command click enter
   # Any line starting with '#' is comment line
   # Install git
   sudo apt-get install git
   # Add a PPA to install required GIS softwares
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
   sudo apt-get update

   sudo apt-get install qgis qgis-plugin-grass
   # Install GRASS GIS and required packages
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:grass/grass-stable
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install grass78
   # Install openpyxl, netCDF4, joblib packages
   # For python 3, use pip3 to install ....
   pip install openpyxl netCDF4 joblib

For other Linux distributions there is detailed instruction to install qgis `here <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html>`_ and grass gis `here <https://grass.osgeo.org/download/software/linux/>`_.

Download source code
++++++++++++++++++++
Open a terminal and type in following git command to download the PySEBAL_dev repository.

.. code-block:: Shell
   :linenos:

   # After each command click enter
   # Any line starting with '#' is comment line
   # change to working directory, 
   # /mnt/d if you are accessing windows D: drive from linux. For example "bash for windows" in windows 10
   cd /mnt/d
   # Clone the PySEBAL_dev repository
   git clone https://github.com/spareeth/PySEBAL_dev.git

Testing installation
++++++++++++++++++++
Open a terminal and type in following codes to test if the installation is successful.

.. code-block:: Shell
   :linenos:

   # After each command click enter
   # Any line starting with '#' is comment line
   # change to the PySEBAL_dev directory, assuming that the repository is cloned in /mnt/d
   cd /mnt/d/PySEBAL_dev/SEBAL
   # List the files inside this folder
   ls
   # Open Python
   python
   import pysebal_py3
   # If there are no errors, the installation is successful
   # To exit from python (ctrl-d)
   exit()

Test run PySEBAL
================

Once PySEBAL is installed, we can run the PySEBAL code using the test data provided with the PySEBAL_dev library. The test data is located in the folder ``PySEBAL_dev\test_data``. If you have installed PySEBAL in ``D:`` drive then it should be ``D:\PySEBAL_dev\test_data``.

| Assuming that PySEBAL_dev is in ``D:`` drive, Let us run the library with test data.

| Open a OSGeo4W Shell and change the directory to ``D:\PySEBAL_dev\SEBAL`` and follow the commands given below.

| **In Windows**

.. code-block:: Shell
   :linenos:

   # After each command click enter
   # Any line starting with '#' is comment line
   # First enable python 3 by typing the following command and 'enter'
   py3_env   
   # change to the PySEBAL_dev\SEBAL directory
   cd D:\PySEBAL_dev\SEBAL
   # Run the PySEBAL script
   python Run_py3.py

| **In Linux**

.. code-block:: Shell
   :linenos:

   # After each command click enter
   # Any line starting with '#' is comment line
   # change to the PySEBAL_dev\SEBAL directory
   cd \mnt\d\PySEBAL_dev\SEBAL
   # Run the PySEBAL script
   python Run_py3.py

After the above commands, there will be a ``output`` folder inside ``D:\PySEBAL\test_data`` with the following structure. 

.. figure:: img/pysebal_folderstr1.png
   :align: center
   :width: 200

.. warning::

   If PySEBAL_dev is not in ``D:`` drive, adapt changes to the path in above commands accordingly. To change the path open the excel sheet ``D:\PySEBAL_dev\docs\InputEXCEL_v3_3_7_WIN.xlsx`` in case of Windows OR open ``D:\PySEBAL_dev\docs\InputEXCEL_v3_3_7_LIN.xlsx`` in case of Linux. You need to change the path in columns B, C & E in the sheet 1.

.. note::

   Now go to the folder ``D:\PySEBAL_dev\test_data\output\Output_evapotranspiration`` and check the daily ETa map (*L8_ETact_24_30m_2014_03_10_069.tif*) in QGIS.
